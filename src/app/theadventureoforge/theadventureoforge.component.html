        <p class="text-center textdesH">The ogre boy and the Mom creature</p>
        <p class="text-center textdes">“The Child and The Creature” is the story of one boy named “Tone”, who has half the blood of a human and an ogre. He cannot live in the human world since humans do not accept his identity. He has only one trusted pet named “Mom”. “Mom” is a legendary creature from Himmaparn forest and it is the reason why he knows his special ability, which is an ability to communicate to all species. with this ability, it makes Tone differ from normal humans and humans consider this ability as dark magic. One day, the human world has a strange event that causes food shortage and catastrophe. He believes that this event can be stopped by accessing Tribhum world (Tribhum world is the world that combines 3 mystery levels in Buddhism including devil layer, angel layer, and spirit layer). The way to get into Tribhum is very dangerous and whoever enters this world never comes back. Since he wants to be accepted by humans, he decides to go into the Tribhum world. That is the beginning of his journey. He has to use his ability to solve the problem and apply it in the human world. </p>
